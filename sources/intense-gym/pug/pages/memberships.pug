                    h6.text-primary How does the 14-day trial work?
                    p If you select a certain workout course of Intense, you can take an opportunity to try it before paying the full price for it. To start the trial, you have to be a registered user of our website and select a training course

                    h6.text-primary Can I change/cancel plans anytime?
                    p After your training course begins, there are two ways of changing or canceling your membership. If you are a new member owning a Starter plan, you can switch to another plan only in half a year. Basic and Pro members can switch to the plan of their choice instantly. Canceling is accessible for all our members regardless of their training package.

                    p After your trial ends, you can pay for your favorite workout course you selected before using cash or credit card.

If you have already been our loyal member for a year or more, you also get permanent discounts on our membership plans.
